### Background

**What is VQE?:** VQE allows us to find an upper bound for the lowest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian describes the behaviour of the physical system and contains all the possible values for the energy of the system (i.e. the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian). The lowest eigenvalue corresponds to the ground state of the system.

Calculating the ground state of a system is difficult to carry out in a classical computer so for this reason we turn our attention to quantum computers.
